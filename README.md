# CEMS: An open-source Camp Event Management System

This repository is currently a stub and will include more details at a later point in time.

## What This Project Does
CEMS is a camp event management system; that is, a web app that allows campsites to manage events that they run. The app allows tracking and allocating of leaders, camp resources and camper information, centralised in one database where multiple users can access and modify as needed. Multiple users can be configured with restricted permissions so that some staff may view information such as medical notes or meal plans, while others can add/remove leaders from upcoming camps, change other data or send out notifications.

## Features / Purpose
The purpose of this system is to provide a centralised, digital platform for camp staff to manage and coordinate camp events. Key goals include the ability for the app to be deployed locally, any modern device can access it, data can be exported and imported as needed, information is securely managed to prevent unauthorised personnel from accessing it and remove unnecessary physical paperwork.

### Features

* Offline caching of data
* Store central pools of resources (leaders, accommodation options, teams, etc)
* Store and provide access to details for each person on camp
* Plan Flows, a way of managing repetitive tasks (Future Goal)
* Archive finished camps with all details
* Responsive, mobile-friendly UI via any modern browser
* Customisable report exports in CSV
